<p>Hello Internet!</p>

<p>My name is Jason Davis, I'm a nerd in just about every way. When I'm not reading the latest Litrpg book or playing video games I find myself working as a Cloud Operations Engineer for 10th Magnitude. My background is 10+ years in the tech industry working on infrastructure and operations.</p>
