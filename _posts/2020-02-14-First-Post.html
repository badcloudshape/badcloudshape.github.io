<h2 class="section-heading">The First Steps</h2>
<p>Passion and insparation come to everyone differently. Recently some co-workers started a blog that made the impossible seem possible and just like that insparation took root.</p>

<p>Now I have worked in technology for over 15 years and you would think that would mean an active internet socal life but I'm more of the classic introvert nerd that perfers video games, reading and puzzle solving from the comfort of my home. thatâ€™s one reason why I have decided a blog in 2020 would be a great way to both move outside my comfort zone and pass on my passions in life.</p>

<p>From a very early age I found my passion or true calling if you will. Being a kid from the 80's, I got to see the rise of technology in the home. VCR's, Nintendo, and the home PC became common place and figuring out how to set the clock on the VCR quickly pointed out to my parents that knowing technology was a very useful skill. I still remember the day I opened the nintendo and played my first video game, it was love at first sight if you will.</p>

<p>It's these memories of old video games which bring me to this blog, which will help me pass on some of my passion and knowledge. the first project will be a how to guide on resurection in the form of EverQuest. I'm going to break it up in to 3 steps</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The 3 Steps on how to build a private EverQuest server IN THE CLOUD!</h2>

<p>The first step seems like the hardest, build the infrastructure that we will run the EverQuest server on. We are planning to build this all in the Azure Cloud, So you are going to want to get an account.</p>

<p>The second step is going to be the setup of the EverQuest software and everything that entails.</p>

<p>The third step is administration, help with running things inside of the game itself</p>
